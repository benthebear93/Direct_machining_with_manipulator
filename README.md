# Direct drilling for unknown surface with high stiffness posture planning
Study period : 2021.01 ~ 2021.11
# Overview
Machining on unknown surface often requries, such as repairing made product that has no CAD data. In this package, depth camera and line scanner were used to generate point cloud of unknown surface. Depth camera used for extracting abstract scanning path which requires for scanning with line scanner. Since depth camera not able gives accurate position values, high resolution line scanner was used to scan unknown surface. Drilling can be done by selecting drilling point position and orientation that acquired from KNN segmentation for normal vector estimation. For better hole quality, high stiffness posture planning was done using reinforcement learning and stiffness estimation model.
